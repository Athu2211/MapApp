Backend
--------
    Express and Mongoose
        npm i express mongoose

    Go to mongodb.com
        => create a cluster
        => click connect
            > connect your application
            > copy the db url "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.1d1jv.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
    
    create index.js

    To run Backend "node filename.js"

    create a .env file so that your mongodb url can be private
        npm i dotenv
        and config it in index.js

    Two files are created under models for "pin" and "user" to create schema

    Two files are created under routes for "pin" and "user"
        where models are imported
        and the routes are imported in index.js
        now using postman data can be posted into db

    Password is created and verified using bycrpt
        const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
        npm i bcrypt
